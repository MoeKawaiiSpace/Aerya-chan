### About
Aerya-chan is the first Sportsbook Discord Bot we ever have (I guess so, don't take it too seriously). 

Don't know what does Sportsbook mean? Here is a short description for you:

_A sportsbook or a race and sports book is a place where a gambler can wager on various sports competitions, including golf, football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, horse racing, greyhound racing, boxing, and mixed martial arts. (Source: Wikipedia)_ 

B-b-but we will have more than that! From Anime to Netflix and whatever that we can bet on, we will try to cover it all!

Aerya also have various function, from Moderation to Anime search, Social profile, Leveling and Economy. Update in the future? Absolutely yes!

### How does the Sportsbook work?
This is the question that mostly people are interesting right? I have the answer for all of you.

Bet slip example: 

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/VWjbONN.png "Example")

- **Date**: Kinda obvious, you know what it mean right?
- **Game**: Basketball, Football, CSGO, League of Legends, Anime, Movies, etc...
- **Event**: For normal sports, it will be the event name. Ex. World Cup | For Anime, it will be the name of the Anime.
- **Match**: Things that we can bet on.
- **Bet on**: You choose either left side or right side.
- **Percentage**: The percentage of people bet on each side. (this will be revealed once the slip is OFF)
- **Odds**: The ratio between the amounts staked by the parties to a bet, based on the expected probability either way. They are also determined by how others are wagering. (this will be revealed once the slip is OFF)
- **Status**: **ON** (mean it's open for place bet) | **OFF** (mean the game is LIVE, or the Anime/Movies is LIVE. Or we just close it but rare case) | **ENDED** (The winner is credited and the result is posted on our [SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4TZLGltQiNdhaZMxtuoHE4x8X1UG0ZZFTurRchLD9Y/edit?usp=sharing))

### What I have to do to get the bet slip to my discord server? 
- First, invite our bot [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=641780922445856768&permissions=8&scope=bot) to your server.
- Second, follow the #sportsbook Announcement channel [Server invite link click here](https://discord.gg/CVhk828) to a channel that you want us to send the slip on your server (I recommended a channel that no one can chat, or the slip will get lost.)

And that's all for you! Enjoy <3.

### How can I place a bet?
I assume you know the slip number, by checking the bet slip that our bot send directly to your discord server or from our [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4TZLGltQiNdhaZMxtuoHE4x8X1UG0ZZFTurRchLD9Y/edit?usp=sharing), the command form is really simple!

**Do you know that you can use this command in Aerya DM?**

```bash
a!bet [bet slip number] [left OR right side] [amount]
```

REMEMBER NOT TO TYPE THE HASHTAG IN BET SLIP NUMBER

```bash
-> a!bet 000001 left 1000 (000001 is the slip number, left mean you bet on left side and 1000 is the amount of Vallis you placed.)
```

### A bet slip that is listed on the spreadsheet but I can't find it on my server, why?
- If you invited the bot and follow the channel after the bet slip posted in Aerya server, then you won't get it. But you still can bet on it with the bet slip number from the spreadsheet anyway.

- If it's not the first reason then please contact us as fast as possible

### What does the [SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4TZLGltQiNdhaZMxtuoHE4x8X1UG0ZZFTurRchLD9Y/edit#gid=1397547932) use for?
I mentioned it above, so I will explain it clearly now. 

Per day, there will be many MATCH that you can bet on. We will try to cover as much as possible so everyone can enjoy it and by that, a day we will have many slip posted. 50 slips? 100? And you won't just staring on your screen the whole day right? We will find another solution (if possible) but for now, we will use the spreadsheet to post the bet slip that will be posted, come with the number and all necessary information. We also update the winner of a slip once is ENDED.

### How can I keep track of what I bet on?

This command will give you info about your ACTIVE bet slip. That's mean you will get information about the bet slip number, amount and what you bet on for the slip that has status ON or OFF only. Ended slip will not be listed here.

**Do you know that you can use this command in Aerya DM?**

```bash
a!bet_list
```

### For the Vallis a.k.a our currency system, how can I get it?
You can get it by stay active on Discord and by donate us! You will get 1500 Vallis per 150xp. And how does the xp gain? 6 XP per message, cool down 60 seconds. So by stay active for 20 minutes, you got 120 XP!

If you want to donate, please contact Aki#1706 (ID:523685858658746397). For 1 USD you will get 23000 Vallis <3
