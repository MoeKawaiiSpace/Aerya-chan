# Aerya-chan
T-T-This is Aerya-chan bot repository... But i-i-it's not like I w-w-want you to look at it or something ok?

### About
Aerya-chan is the first Sportsbook Discord Bot we ever have (I guess so, don't take it too seriously). 

Don't know what does Sportsbook mean? Here is a short description for you: _A sportsbook or a race and sports book is a place where a gambler can wager on various sports competitions, including golf, football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, horse racing, greyhound racing, boxing, and mixed martial arts. (Source: Wikipedia)_ 

B-b-but we will have more than that! From Anime to Netflix and whatever that we can bet on, we will try to cover it all!

Other than that, Aerya also have various function, from Moderation to Anime search, Social profile, Leveling and Economy. We will have more in the future!

### How does the Sportsbook work?
This is the question that mostly people are interesting right? I have the answer for all of you.

Bet slip example: 

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/VWjbONN.png "Bet slip example")

- **Date**: Kinda obvious, you know what it mean right?
- **Game**: Basketball, Football, CSGO, League of Legends, Anime, Movies, etc...
- **Event**: For normal sports, it will be the event name. Ex. World Cup | For Anime, it will be the name of the Anime.
- **Match**: Things that we can bet on.
- **Bet on**: You choose either left side or right side.
- **Percentage**: The percentage of people bet on each side. (this will be revealed once the slip is OFF)
- **Odds**: The ratio between the amounts staked by the parties to a bet, based on the expected probability either way. They are also determined by how others are wagering. (this will be revealed once the slip is OFF)
- **Status**: ON (mean it's open for place bet) | OFF (mean the game is LIVE, or the Anime/Movies is LIVE. Or we just close it but rare case) | ENDED (The winner is credited and the result is posted on our [SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4TZLGltQiNdhaZMxtuoHE4x8X1UG0ZZFTurRchLD9Y/edit?usp=sharing))

### What I have to do to get the bet slip? 
- First, invite our bot [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=641780922445856768&permissions=8&scope=bot) to your server.
- Second, follow the #sportsbook Announcement channel [Server invite link click here](https://discord.gg/CVhk828) to a channel that you want us to send the slip on your server (I recommended a channel that no one can chat, or the slip will get lost.)

And that's all for you! Enjoy <3.

### How can I place a bet?
I assume you know the slip number, by checking the bet slip that our bot send directly to your discord server or from our [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x4TZLGltQiNdhaZMxtuoHE4x8X1UG0ZZFTurRchLD9Y/edit?usp=sharing), the command form is really simple!

```bash
a!bet [bet slip number] [left OR right side] [amount]
```

```bash
-> a!bet 000001 left 1000 (000001 is the slip number, left mean you bet on left side and 1000 is the amount of Vallis you placed.)
```
